# secret-santa
Python script to draw names for Secret Santa gift exchange.

## Purpose
I was asked to draw the names for my family's secret santa and I thought: well, I can develop a program to do this. So I did.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3

### Instructions
- Make sure you use an appropriate template message, you can change the `templateMessage.txt` if you want.
- Put your contacts and their e-mail in `contacts.csv` and let the program deal with it.
- Simply run ```python secretSanta.py```.

## Aknowlegments
- I used [this link](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/send-emails-using-code-4fcea9df63f) to get started with the e-mail part.
